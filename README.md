# Professional README Generator

## Background
Through the use of Node, I have developed an application for a developer to generator a README markdown file so that they can quickly create a professional README for their intended project.

## Generator Targets
Through the command-line the following will take place:
- When prompted for information about my application repository
- Then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
- When the project title is entered
- Then it is displayed as the title of the README
- When a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions are entered
-  Then the information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
- When a license is chosen for the application from a list of options
- Then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
- When the user enters their GitHub username
- Then it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
- When the user enters their email address
- Then it added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
- When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents
- Then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
